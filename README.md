# Simple JavaScript Soap Calculator

*I originally created this calculator back in 2018*

This soap calculator can determine how much lye is needed to create soap from the following oils:

| Oil      | SAP value |
|----------|-------|
| olive    | 0.134 |
| coconut  | 0.190 |
| castor   | 0.128 |
| hemp     | 0.136 |
| babassu  | 0.175 |

The following oil values still have to be added:

* sunflower
* apricot
